        — Joe Flacco is 38 years old, but he says feels like a 10-year-old kid.
        The Cleveland Browns are thankful for that youthful feeling. Flacco is
        back playing in the NFL on a Browns team trying to claw its way into the
        playoffs – and he’s been named the starter for the rest of the season
        with four games to go. On Sunday, as he outdueled Jacksonville
        quarterback Trevor Lawrence, Flacco threw 26-of-45 for 311 yards and
        three touchdowns as the Browns held off the Jaguars 31-27 to stop a
        two-game losing streak.
